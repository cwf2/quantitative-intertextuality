CHAPTER CXIII.



ENTITLED, THE DAYBREAK; WHERE IT WAS REVEALED IS DISPUTED.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     SAY, I fly for refuge unto the LORD of the daybreak,

     that he may deliver me from the mischief of those things which he hath

created;

     and from the mischief of the night, when it cometh on;

     and from the mischief of women blowing on knots;

     and from the mischief of the envious, when he envieth.
