CHAPTER XCVIII.



ENTITLED, THE EVIDENCE; WHERE IT WAS REVEALED IS DISPUTED.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     THE unbelievers among those to whom the scriptures were given, and among

the idolaters, did not stagger, until the clear evidence had come unto them:

     an apostle from GOD, rehearsing unto them pure books of revelations;

     wherein are contained right discourses.

     Neither were they unto whom the scriptures were given divided among

themselves, until after the clear evidence had come unto them.

     And they were commanded no other in the scriptures than to worship GOD,

exhibiting unto him the pure religion, and being orthodox; and to be constant

at prayer, and to give alms; and this is the right religion.

     Verily those who believe not, among those who have received the

scriptures, and among the idolaters, shall be cast into the fire of hell, to

remain therein forever.  These are the worst of creatures.

     But they who believe, and do good works; these are the best of creatures:

     their reward with their LORD shall be gardens of perpetual abode, through

which rivers flow; they shall remain therein forever.  GOD will be well pleased in

them; and they shall be well pleased in him.  This is prepared for him who shall

fear his LORD.
