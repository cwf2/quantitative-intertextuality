CHAPTER CX.



ENTITLED, ASSISTANCE; REVEALED AT MECCA.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     WHEN the assistance of GOD shall come, and the victory;

     and thou shalt see the people enter into the religion of GOD by troops:

     celebrate the praise of thy LORD, and ask pardon of him; for he is

inclined to forgive.
