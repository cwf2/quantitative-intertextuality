CHAPTER XCV.



ENTITLED, THE FIG; WHERE IT WAS REVEALED IS DISPUTED.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     BY the fig, and the olive;

     and by mount Sinai,

     and this territory of security;

     verily we created man of a most excellent fabric;

     afterwards we rendered him the vilest of the vile:

     except those who believe, and work righteousness; for they shall receive

an endless reward.

     What, therefore, shall cause thee to deny the day of judgment after

this?

     Is not GOD the most wise judge?
