CHAPTER CIX.



ENTITLED, THE UNBELIEVERS; REVEALED AT MECCA.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     SAY: O unbelievers,

     I will not worship that which ye worship;

     nor will ye worship that which I worship.

     Neither do I worship that which ye worship;

     neither do ye worship that which I worship.

     Ye have your religion, and I my religion.
