CHAPTER XCI.



ENTITLED, THE SUN; REVEALED AT MECCA.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     BY the Sun, and its rising brightness;

     by the moon when she followeth him;

     by the day, when it showeth its splendor;

     by the night, when it covereth him with darkness;

     by the heaven, and him who built it;

     by the earth, and him who spread it forth;

     by the soul, and him who completely formed it,

     and inspired into the same its faculty of distinguishing, and power of

choosing, wickedness and piety:

     now is he who hath purified the same, happy;

10     but he who hath corrupted the same, is miserable.

     Thamud accused their prophet Saleh of imposture, through the excess of

their wickedness:

     when the wretch among them was sent to slay the camel;

     and the apostle of GOD said unto them, Let alone the camel of GOD; and

hinder not her drinking.

     But they charged him with imposture; and they slew her.  Wherefore their

LORD destroyed them, for their crime, and made their punishment equal unto

them all:

     and he feareth not the issue thereof.
