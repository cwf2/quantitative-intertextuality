CHAPTER CVII.



ENTITLED, NECESSARIES; WHERE IT WAS REVEALED IS DISPUTED.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     WHAT thinkest thou of him who denieth the future judgment as a falsehood?

     It is he who pusheth away the orphan;

     and stirreth not up others to feed the poor.

     Woe be unto those who pray,

     and who are negligent at their prayer:

     who play the hypocrites,

     and deny necessaries to the needy.
