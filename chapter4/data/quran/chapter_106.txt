CHAPTER CVI.



ENTITLED, KOREISH; REVEALED AT MECCA.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     FOR the uniting of the tribe of Koreish;

     their uniting in sending forth the caravan of merchants and purveyors in

winter and summer;

     let them serve the LORD of this house;

     who supplieth them with food against hunger,

     and hath rendered them secure from fear.
