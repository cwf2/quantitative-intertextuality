CHAPTER XCIX.



ENTITLED, THE EARTHQUAKE; WHERE IT WAS REVEALED IS DISPUTED.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     WHEN the earth shall be shaken by an earthquake;

     and the earth shall cast forth her burdens;

     and a man shall say, What aileth her?

     On that day the earth shall declare her tidings,

     for that thy LORD will inspire her.

     On that day men shall go forward in distinct classes, that they may

behold their works.

     And whoever shall have wrought good of the weight of an ant, shall

behold the same.

     And whoever shall have wrought evil of the weight of an ant, shall behold

the same.
