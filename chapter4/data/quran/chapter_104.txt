CHAPTER CIV.



ENTITLED, THE SLANDERER; REVEALED AT MECCA.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     WOE unto every slanderer, and backbiter:

     who heapeth up riches, and prepareth the same for the time to come!

     He thinketh that his riches will render him immortal.

     By no means.  He shall surely be cast into Al Hotama.

     And who shall cause thee to understand what Al Hotama is?

     It is the kindled fire of GOD;

     which shall mount above the hearts of those who shall be cast therein.

     Verily it shall be as an arched vault above them

     on columns of vast extent.
