CHAPTER CII.



ENTITLED, THE EMULOUS DESIRE OF MULTIPLYING; WHERE IT WAS REVEALED IS

DISPUTED.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     THE emulous desire of multiplying riches and children employeth you,

     until ye visit the graves.

     By no means should ye thus employ your time: hereafter shall ye know your

folly.

     Again, By no means: hereafter shall ye know your folly.

     By no means: if ye knew the consequence hereof with certainty of

knowledge, ye would not act thus.

     Verily ye shall see hell:

     again, ye shall surely see it with the eye of certainty.

     Then shall ye be examined, on that day, concerning the pleasures with

which ye have amused yourselves in this life.
