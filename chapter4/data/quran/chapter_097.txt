CHAPTER XCVII.



ENTITLED, AL KADR; WHERE IT WAS REVEALED IS DISPUTED.



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     VERILY we sent down the Koran in the night of al Kadr.

     And what shall make thee understand how excellent the night of al Kadr

is?

     The night of al Kadr is better than a thousand months.

     Therein do the angels descend, and the spirit of Gabriel also, by the

permission of their LORD, with his decrees concerning every matter.

     It is peace until the rising of the morn.
