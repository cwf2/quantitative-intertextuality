CHAPTER XCIV.



ENTITLED, HAVE WE NOT OPENED; REVEALED AT MECCA



IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD.



     HAVE we not opened thy breast;

     and eased thee of thy burden,

     which galled thy back;

     and raise thy reputation for thee?

     Verily a difficulty shall be attended with ease.

     Verily a difficulty shall be attended with ease.

     When thou shalt have ended thy preaching; labor to serve God in return

for his favours;

     and make thy supplication unto thy LORD.
