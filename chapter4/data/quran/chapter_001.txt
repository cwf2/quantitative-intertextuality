CHAPTER I.



ENTITLED, THE PREFACE, OR INTRODUCTION; REVEALED AT MECCA.



     IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD

     PRAISE be to GOD, the LORD of all creatures;

     the most merciful,

     the king of the day of judgment.

     Thee do we worship, and of thee do we beg assistance.

     Direct us in the right way,

     in the way of those to whom thou hast been gracious; not of those against

whom thou art incensed, nor of those who go astray.
