His eyes meet mine and I notice that his eyes are green, he hasn't actually made eye contact with me until now. He looks away quickly and I walk past him out of the bathroom. He grabs my arm, not gently and pulls me back.

"Do not touch me!" I yell and jerk my arm from him.

"Have you been crying?" he asks, his tone curious. If it wasn't Harry I might actually think he was concerned.

"Just leave me alone Harry" he stands in front of me, his tall frame blocking my movements. I can't take much more of his games. "Harry, please. I am begging you, if you have one decent bone in your body you will leave me be. Just save whatever mean comment you are going to say for tomorrow. Please" I beg him, literally. A flash of confusion flashes in his eyes before he speaks.

"There is a room down the hall you can sleep in, Steph is already in there." he says. I wait a second for him to say something else, but he doesn't. He just stares at me.

"Okay" I say and he moves out of my way.

"It's the third door on the left." he instructs and heads down the hall. 
"Goodnight Theresa" I hear as he disappears into his bedroom. What the hell was that? Harry without any rude comments? I know I am in for it if I see him tomorrow. He is probably already planning out all the snide comments he will make to me.

The third room on the left is a plain room, much smaller than Harry's with two small beds. It looks more like a dorm room than the large room that Harry has. Maybe he is the leader or something? The more likely explanation is that everyone is afraid of him and he bullied his way into the largest room. Steph is laying across one of the beds so I kick off my shoes and cover her with the blanket before locking the door and laying down on the other bed. My thoughts are all over the place as I fall asleep, images of swallows and green eyes flow through my dreams.
