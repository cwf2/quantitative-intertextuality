“Please don’t hurt me. Please don’t hurt me. No... stay away from me.” She was crying in pain but he was all over her, touching her everywhere, hurting her everywhere, torturing her everywhere.
 
“You frigid girl. You are as cold as ice. You are nothing but a wasted piece of dead meat. When will you learn to warm your husband’s bed?” He was drunk, pouring dirty words in her ears. 

She tried to push him away. “I am your wife. Please have some mercy. I am having your baby.” 

“My baby? A whore carrying my baby? I saw you talking to someone in my bedroom and you say you are the mother of my child, you hooker. Come here, you bitch, I want to fuck you so hard that you will forget everything other than your husband.” He pulled her by her hair over to the bed. “You fuck other men behind my back, and you defy your own husband. Where is that asshole, you whore?” 

“Please don’t call me that. Show some respect. I swear there was no one in the room. I swear on my baby. If you think you made a mistake by marrying me, then free me.” She was trying hard to breathe. 

“Free you? You think I will leave you so soon? I married a fool. I thought you'd bring wealth to me. You betrayed me. All you brought with you is this shit dead body with no heart.” 

He slapped her hard in the face. She was crying in pain, trying to catch her breath. 

“I will not give you my money for your drugs and other women—” She twisted away from him and tried to get to the door. 

He grabbed her. “Where the fuck do you think you are going? You dead shit —” 

“No, let me go. You are hurting me... ah...” She cried out, but there was no one to hear her. No one to come to her rescue. A man was fucking her hard, bruising her body, crushing her soul. She had no escape. She cried from her eyes and from her heart. 

She didn’t complain, as she knew she was cursed.
