"It turns out that whenever we are slightly bored—when reality isn't quite enough for us—we begin exploring our own associations, contemplating counterfactuals and fictive scenarios that only exist within the head.","For one thing, it turns out that the mind wanders a ridiculous amount.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"According to a recent study led by the Harvard psychologists Daniel Gilbert and Matthew A. Killingsworth, people let their minds wander forty-seven per cent of the time they are awake.","The mental condition, after all, is defined by its lack of stimulation; it's the mind at its most apathetic.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"At first glance, such data seems like a confirmation of our inherent laziness.","However, as Brodsky also noted, boredom and its synonyms can also become a crucial tool of creativity.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"A daydream is that fountain spurting, spilling strange new thoughts into the stream of consciousness.","Last year, the Harvard psychologists Daniel Gilbert and Matthew A. Killingsworth published a fascinating paper in Science documenting our penchant for disappearing down the rabbit hole of our own mind.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"Subjects were then randomly assigned to one of four different conditions.","What's happening inside the brain when the mind wanders?",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"And these spurts turn out to be surprisingly useful.","The end result is that their mind’s eye is always focused inwards.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"Given repeated items, the daydreamers came up with forty-one per cent more possibilities than students in the other conditions.","In addition to default network activation, mind wandering was associated with executive network recruitment, a finding predicted by behavioral theories of off-task thought and its relation to executive resources.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"Schooler argues that it's clear evidence that those twelve minutes of daydreaming allowed the subjects to invent additional possibilities, as their unconscious minds pondered new ways to make use of toothpicks.","Finally, neural recruitment in both default and executive network regions was strongest when subjects were unaware of their own mind wandering, suggesting that mind wandering is most pronounced when it lacks meta-awareness.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"The benefit of these simple tasks is that they consume just enough attention to keep us occupied, while leaving plenty of mental resources left over for errant daydreams.","The observed parallel recruitment of executive and default network regions—two brain systems that so far have been assumed to work in opposition—suggests that mind wandering may evoke a unique mental state that may allow otherwise opposing networks to work in cooperation.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"Consider the ping-pong tables that now seem to exist in the lobby of every Silicon Valley startup.","The second is the simultaneous activation in executive and default regions, suggesting that mind wandering isn't quite as mindless as we'd long imagined.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"While it's easy to dismiss such interior decorations as mere whimsy, the game turns out to be an ideal mind-wandering activity, at least when played casually.","Instead, a daydream seems to exist in the liminal space between sleep dreaming and focused attentiveness, in which we are still awake but not really present.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds

"Although Schooler has previously demonstrated a correlation between daydreaming and creativity—those who are more prone to mind-wandering tend to be better at generating new ideas, at least in the lab—this new paper shows that our daydreams seem to serve a similar function as night dreams, facilitating bursts of creative insight.","This suggests that these poor subjects were trapped within a daydreaming loop, unable to exercise their executive regions to pay attention to the world outside.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds

"The researchers gave a group of students a tedious task that involved transforming a long list of number strings into a new set of number strings.","The last bit of mind wandering research worth highlighting also comes from the Schooler lab.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"Wagner and Born designed the task so that there was an elegant shortcut, but it could only be uncovered if the subject had an insight about the problem.","However, not all daydreams are equally effective at inspiring new ideas.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"When people were left to their own devices, less than twenty per cent of them found the shortcut, even when given several hours to mull over the task.","In his experiments, Schooler distinguishes between two types of daydreaming.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"The act of dreaming, however, changed everything: after people were allowed to lapse into R.E.M. sleep, nearly sixty per cent of them discovered the secret pattern.","Although they've been told to press a button as soon as they realize their mind has started to wander, these people fail to press the button.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"If this all sounds like scientific justification for afternoon naps, long showers, and Russian literature, you're right.","The point is that it's not enough to simply daydream.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
"If you're trying to solve a complex problem, then you need to give yourself a real break, to let the mind incubate the problem all by itself.","Instead of completely zoning out, we should work on staying a little more self-aware, ensuring there's still some activity in the executive areas of the brain.",../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_virtues_of_daydreaming.rds,../data/corpus/ref_corpus_rds/lehrer_the_importance_of_mind_wandering.rds
